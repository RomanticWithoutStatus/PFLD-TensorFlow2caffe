# PFLD-TensorFlow2caffe
PFLD is used to detect facial landmarks. Its function mainly benefits from loss function and auxiliary network. 
PFLD's paper is : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.10859.pdf [0] .
which is implemented in Tensorflow is : https://github.com/guoqiangqi/PFLD  [1] .

# This Project
this model is train from [1], which author helped me a lot. and than, train and get the final TF model . I made a little change in [1]'s tensorflow model to fit the caffe model I need. finally, I conversion PFLD TF model to caffe model.
